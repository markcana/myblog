**Reason why did I use linux?**

Why am I using Linux in the first place?

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus was very rampant. The government was locking down public places and preventing people from going outside as much as possible. Businesses closed down, jobs became more scarce, prices rose, and computers were no exception.

Classes were conducted online, and because of that, I really needed a device that I could use to attend classes, especially since the degree I’m pursuing is Information Technology. During the start of my freshman year, I actually don’t have a device to use, but luckily my friend lend me his PC to attend lectures and to do my schoolwork.

Eventually, my parents managed to buy me a second-hand computer for my online class. Let’s just say it sucks. It has an old OEM motherboard in a cheap “gaming PC case” with crappy Molex rainbow puke fans. It was rocking an Intel 750 and a GeForce 9500 GT (for reference, this was the year Intel released their Comet Lake CPUs and Nvidia their 3000 series GPUs) with 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB hard drive. It’s actually my first ever computer, and I can’t just refuse something my parents gave to me, especially since we were also struggling financially at that time.

With Windows 10 as its OS, the computer was really slow. It was lagging when the MS Teams app was opened along with some browser tabs. As a broke college student, I couldn’t even afford to upgrade it to an SSD.

Using it to do work is really frustrating, and this forced me to search the internet for ways to optimize Windows, like disabling animations, debloating, and other tweaks. One day, while I was searching for more solutions, I encountered an article about how to make my computer more responsive—this is when I read about Linux. I watched videos of old hardware that uses Linux. It was awesome how it became responsive and usable upon using it. I was immediately hooked and gave Linux a try.

**Preparations that I made**

But before fully trying it, I did some research about Linux and how it works on a very surface level.

It seems that Linux has a learning curve since it doesn’t work the same as Windows.

I watched videos on how to install it, set up partitions, basic shell commands, etc.

With some knowledge, the first distribution I installed was one of the most popular distros that can also run on old hardware: Linux Mint. I played around with the system for a while to test the waters and familiarize myself.

I also tried installing Void, Arch, Ubuntu, and many other operating systems to see which one would feel right for me.

During the sem break, I did the leap of faith and jump straight to installing Linux in bare metal. Oh, the distro I installed? Debian. Desktop Environment? XFCE since based from my research it's very minimal.

**How was the first impressions**

After installing and using it in real hardware, you will really feel the difference from just simply moving the mouse pointer, opening applications, searching in the file manager, and other minor things.

Everything feels so smooth it’s actually impressive.

Debian is packaged with the very vanilla XFCE that makes the system look outdated, so I riced it a bit with some blurs, a dock, themes, and icons.

While customizing my desktop, I’m actually being mindful of what things I could add since I don’t want to have it eat a lot of resources. But due to how lightweight the distro and the desktop environment are, there’s no problem there.

**Software alternatives to some applications**

Software availability in Linux is one of the cons you would encounter when using it. Some applications were available natively, and some need a little bit of tinkering to get installed and up and running. I also learned about the technologies I can use to get an app running without it being available in local repo, like universal packaging formats such as Flatpaks, AppImages, and Snap. There are also compatibility layers like Wine and Proton.

For my schoolworks, here were some of the applications I used from Windows and what I used upon migrating:

- **Office Applications**: MS Office -> Libreoffice

- **Media Player**: Windows' video player -> VLC/MPV

- **IDE**: VS Code still available 

- **Localhost**: Xampp still available

- **PhotoEditor**: Photoshop -> GIMP

- **Video Editor**: Filmora -> Kdenlive

For the work I am doing, the applications I needed were available natively, but some like Xampp are a little bit of a pain to get up and running since it needs some tinkering, but it’s manageable. The alternatives work fine for my use case, so I don’t have any issue regarding the tools for my studies.

**How was my productivity after the migration**

Using Linux regularly for months, I customized my workflow to better suit me. Here are some examples: making shortcut keys for opening applications and using basic window tiling. Of course, this can be done on pretty much any OS, but back then I was so frustrated that I didn’t even think of these things. I just wanted to finish what I was doing as soon as possible.

Since migrating to Linux, opening and loading applications has become noticeably faster. This may not seem like much, but when you do it repeatedly, the time really adds up. I also learned new tools like Kdenlive and GIMP after coming from Photoshop and Filmora. If you expect them to be exact copies, it can be frustrating at first but give it a little time and you’ll eventually be fine.

There are also no more “Not Responding” windows, which is very welcome. It actually made me enjoy using my computer again. That enjoyment motivated me and improved my overall productivity.

I even did my entire college internship on my Linux desktop, and it turned out great.

**Things I learned**

I will not be saying the obvious here, like I learned to use the terminal, how my system works, this and that, basically the technical stuff.

I would like to focus on the big picture. Like the importance of FOSS. It’s amazing how much strangers all around the world can do if they actually decide to work together. Nowadays, people are getting more and more frustrated with these big corporations doing some questionable and greedy decisions with their products that negatively affect us users. Old computers that are now targets of planned obsolescence are still usable, promoting sustainability and pushing back against consumerism.

The issue about privacy has been a topic for years. With proprietary software, users are forced to trust companies on what they will do to our data and how it is being handled. Unlike FOSS, which offers a different approach built with freedom and transparency.

The one behind it all is a community-driven movement and the collective of people that have the same vision and ideas, which gives us these wonderful things. We benefit from something someone made without us knowing them, and that’s beautiful.

**Moving forward**

I can’t see myself choosing other operating systems made by big corpos over Linux. The freedom, modularity, speed, and respect it gives me when it comes to controlling my own system is something I wouldn’t trade anytime soon. I will still be using Linux onwards, and I hope you give it a shot yourself.
