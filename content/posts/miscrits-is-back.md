If you are old enough, you may remember the time when people were playing games on Facebook. It was either managing your farm in FarmVille, or building your base in Social Empire or Social Wars. There was also playing against your friends in Tetris.

But do you remember the game Miscrits?

It’s an RPG which focuses mainly on creatures called Miscrits, made by Broken Bulb Studios. You could either capture, buy, or have them gifted to you. You could also train them to be used for battles against wild Miscrits, bosses, or other players’ Miscrits. It’s basically inspired by a certain Japanese game with a yellow mascot.

I actually played Miscrits first instead of Pokémon as a kid. Back then, consoles for those games were really expensive and hard to find, unlike Miscrits, which was free-to-play and very accessible in my case. I remember playing Miscrits from the pisonets near our house. This was the first game I actually put real playing time into, playing it on and off starting from 2012 up to 2016.

Sadly, it got discontinued due to multiple factors. One of these was Facebook gaming being in decline, along with the game’s revenue. This caused the game to become unprofitable. There was also the issue of it being too pay-to-win. It was so bad that you would pretty much see the same Miscrits lineup in the battle arena. In 2017, the game was unplugged and became unplayable.

Fast forward to 2025 — Miscrits is back.

The official return date was May 25, 2025, and this time it’s available on multiple platforms: Steam for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as the App Store and Google Play Store for mobile devices. The release of the game was a success and was well-received by the community. The team behind it, Lightning Ball Studios, has been very steadfast with development and updates.

There’s a good balance of old and original content, like maps and Miscrits, which gives excitement to both old and new players alike. The game is now much better balance-wise, with regular patches that give different Miscrits their own niches and promote creative team building.

Miscrits certainly is part of my life growing up. And right now, as a working adult, whenever I have free time or I’m commuting to work, I play it to kill time and as a breather. I want the game to succeed not just because of nostalgia, but because it’s genuinely a fun game.
