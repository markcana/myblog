&lt;p&gt;Why am I using Linux in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus was very rampant. The government was locking down public places and preventing people from going outside as much as possible. Businesses closed down, jobs became more scarce, prices rose, and computers were no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Classes were conducted online, and because of that, I really needed a device I could use to attend classes—especially since the degree I&amp;rsquo;m pursuing is Information Technology. My friend let me borrow his spare computer to attend lectures and complete schoolwork. I used it to complete my schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
