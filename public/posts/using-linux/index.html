Reason why did I use linux?
Why am I using Linux in the first place?
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus was very rampant. The government was locking down public places and preventing people from going outside as much as possible. Businesses closed down, jobs became more scarce, prices rose, and computers were no exception.

      Using Linux

<p><strong>Reason why did I use linux?</strong></p>
<p>Why am I using Linux in the first place?</p>
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus was very rampant. The government was locking down public places and preventing people from going outside as much as possible. Businesses closed down, jobs became more scarce, prices rose, and computers were no exception.</p>
<p>Classes were conducted online, and because of that, I really needed a device I could use to attend classes—especially since the degree I&rsquo;m pursuing is Information Technology. My friend let me borrow his spare computer to attend lectures and complete schoolwork. I used it to complete my schoolwork.</p>
<p>Eventually, my parents managed to buy me a second-hand computer for my online class. It had an old OEM motherboard in a “gaming PC case” with crappy Molex rainbow puke fans. It was rocking an Intel 750 and a GeForce 9500 GT (for reference, this was the year Intel released their Comet Lake CPUs and Nvidia their 3000 series GPUs) with 4 GB of RAM and a 500 GB hard drive.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 as its OS, the computer was really slow. It was lagging when the MS Teams app was opened along with some browser tabs. As a broke college student, I couldn’t afford to upgrade it to an SSD.</p>
<p>This forced me to search the internet for ways to optimize Windows, like disabling animations, debloating, and other tweaks. One day, while searching for more solutions, I encountered an article about how to make my computer more responsive—and one of the options suggested installing Linux.</p>
<p><strong>Preparations that I made</strong></p>
<p>I did some research about Linux and how it works on a very surface level.</p>
<p>It seems that Linux has a learning curve and it doesn’t work the same as Windows.</p>
<p>I watched videos on how to install it, set up partitions, basic shell commands, etc.</p>
<p>With some knowledge, the first distribution I installed was one of the most popular distros that can also run on old hardware: Linux Mint. I played around with the system for a while to test the waters and familiarize myself.</p>
<p>I also tried installing Void, Arch, Ubuntu, and many other operating systems to see which one would feel right for me.</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" src="/images/1.2.png"></p>
<p align="center"><small>One of my first installs in a virtual box</small>
<p>During the sem break I did the leap of faith and jump straight to installing linux in bare metal. Oh, the distro I installed? Debian. Desktop Environment? XFCE (for obvious reasons).</p>
<p><strong>How was the first impressions</strong></p>
<p>After installing and using it in real hardware, you will really feel the difference from just simply moving the mouse pointer, opening applications, searching in the file manager, and other minor things.</p>
<p>Everything feels so smooth, impressive.</p>
<p>Debian is packaged with the very vanilla XFCE that makes the system look outdated, so I riced it a bit with some blurs, a dock, themes, and icons.</p>
<p>While customizing my desktop, I&rsquo;m actually being mindful of what things I could add since I don&rsquo;t want to have it eat a lot of resources. But due to how lightweight the distro and the desktop environment are, there&rsquo;s no problem there.</p>
<p><strong>Software alternatives to some applications</strong></p>
<p>Software availability in linux is one of the cons you would encounter when using it. Some applications were available natively and some needs a little bit of tinkering to get installed and get up and running. I also learned about the technologies I can use to get an app running without it being available in local repo like universal packaging format like Flatpaks, Appimages, and Snap, there&rsquo;s also compatibility layers like Wine and Proton. For my schoolworks here were some of the applications I used from windows and I used upon migrating.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Office Applications</strong>: MS Office -&gt; Libreoffice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Media Player</strong>: Windows&rsquo; video player -&gt; VLC/MPV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>IDE</strong>: VS Code still available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Localhost</strong>: Xampp still available</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PhotoEditor</strong>: Photoshop -&gt; GIMP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Video Editor</strong>: Filmora -&gt; Kdenlive</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For the work I am doing, the applications I needed was available natively but some like Xampp are a little bit pain to get up and running since it needs some tinkering but its managable. The alternatives works fine for my use case so I don&rsquo;t have any issue regarding the tools for my studies.</p>
<p><strong>How was my productivity after the migration</strong></p>
<p>Using Linux regularly for months, I customized my workflow to better suit me. Here are some examples: making shortcut keys for opening applications and using basic window tiling. Of course, this can be done on pretty much any OS, but back then I was so frustrated that I didn’t even think of these things—I just wanted to finish what I was doing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Since migrating to Linux, opening and loading applications has become noticeably faster. This may not seem like much, but when you do it repeatedly, the time really adds up. I also learned new tools like Kdenlive and GIMP after coming from Photoshop and Filmora. If you expect them to be exact copies, it can be frustrating—but give it a little time and you’ll eventually be fine.</p>
<p>There are also no more “Not Responding” windows, which is very welcome. It actually made me enjoy using my computer again. That enjoyment motivated me and improved my overall productivity.</p>
<p>I even did my entire college internship on my Linux desktop, and it turned out great.</p>
<p><strong>Things I learned</strong>
<img alt="Screenshot" loading="lazy" src="/images/1.3.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>My new secondhand computer with way better specs running Linux</small>
<p>I will not be saying the obvious here like I learned to use the terminal, how my system works, this and that, basically the technical stuffs.</p>
<p>I would look like to focus on the big picture. Like the importance of FOSS, its amazing how much strangers all around the world can do if they actually decide to work together. Nowadays, people are getting more and more frustrated with these big corporations doing some questionable and greedy decisions with their products that negatively affects us users . Old computers that are now target of planned obscelescene are still usable promoting sustainability and pushing back against consumerism.</p>
<p>The issue about privacy which has been a topic for years and their proprietary software, users are forced to trust the companies on what will they do to our data and how is it being handled. Unlike, FOSS that offers a different approach built with freedom and transparency.</p>
<p>The one behind it all is community driven movement and the collective of people that has the same vision and ideas which gives us this wonderful things is very admirable. We benefit from something someone made without us knowing them and that&rsquo;s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>Moving forward</strong></p>
<p>I will still be using linux for years and onward.</p>
